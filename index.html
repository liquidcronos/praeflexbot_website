<h1> Welcome to the TriPed Project </h1>
<p> THE Triped Project is part of a larger Cooperation between the <a href="https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/ziti/en/institute/research/38-ziti-group/menue/560-automation-laboratory">Proaut lab</a>, the <a href="https://www.lorenzomasia.com/lab-and-people">aries lab</a> and the University of Stuttgart.</p>

<p>We are interested in the cooperation of humans and machinesm particularly how machines can help people walk.
For this purpose the University of Stuttgart has developed a new system in according to the specifications of the product lab and delivered to the <a href="https://www.lorenzomasia.com/lab-and-people">aries lab</a>.</p>

<p>This system consists of three independent, one-legged robots, which are connected by a common platform.
The goal is to investigate how several independent systems can walk together or even climb stairs. <br>
The findings will be used to develop and control "automatic crutches" that walk on their own while stabilising the user.

<h1> Student involvment </h1>
The project, called TriPed, will start in the winter semester 2020/2021 and will be largely supported by students. <br>
Interested students can not only make their mark on the project, but also may be able to be part of a scientific publication.<br>

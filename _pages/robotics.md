If the TriPed peaked your interest, you might ask yourself how you can get involved in Robotics at the Heidelberg University.
This Site is a short overwiev of available lectures and practicals and how they would help you getting the necesarry knowledge to be involved with the TriPed.

All of these courses are part of the <a href="https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/ziti/en/institute/research"> Ziti</a>, which offers the nonconsecutive Master  <a href="https://www.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/ziti/de/studium/msc-ti/502-profil-des-studiengangs"> computer engineering </a>.  
The Master offeres a specialisation in Robotics with which multiple of these courses are acosiated with.  
It should be noted however that most of these courses are also be attendet by physics, maths and computer science students, please check your "modulhandbuch" for more information.



## Theoretical Robotics Courses
The following courses provide theoretical foundations obout robotics.  
Students will learn how to model a robot like the TriPed and controll it using optimal control techniques. 
#### Robotics 1

#### Robotics 2

#### Biomechanics and Biorobotics

#### Haptics and Human Robot Interaction / Rehabilitation

## Practical Robotics Courses
The following courses provide practical experience obout robotics. 
Students will learn how to programm robots using a variety of industry standart tools.
#### Robotics Practica

#### Robotic Games

## Courses on Embedded Controller Design
While not technically about robotics, the triped robot is dependent opon embedded controllers witch actuate its legs and ensure the safety of the system.  
Such controllers can be implemented on microcontrollers, FGGAs or other embedded hardware.  
The following courses provide not only the foundation of control theory (on which a lot of robotic tools build upon) but also intrduction to embedded development.
#### Control Systems Design

#### Reconfigurable Embedded Systems

#### Parallel System Architecture

#### Microcontroller Based Embedded Systems
